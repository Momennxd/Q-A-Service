## 1. Overview

**What is the Q-A Service?**  
This is a backend service built around three core roles:

- **Creators** (teachers, institutions) who author content  
- **Consumers** (students) who practice and compete  
- **Content** (Collections of Questions)

At its heart, the main content unit is the **Question**, grouped into **Collections**.  Beyond simple Q&A, the system:

- Tracks **submissions** per user & per collection  
- Awards **points** for correct answers  
- Ranks users on **collection-specific** and **global leaderboards**  
- Provides **profiles** & **personal libraries** for every user  
- Supports a **full-text search engine** to find collections, questions, or other users

## 2. Main Concepts

### 1 User  
- Represents a person or institution (role: consumer or creator)  
- Holds a profile (name, email, avatar, bio) and a personal library of saved collections  

### 2 Question  
- Text or image prompt + multiple choices  
- At least one correct answer, optional explanation for learning  

### 3 Collection  
- A named group of questions, with description, reviews, likes/dislikes  
- Created & published by a Creator; can be public or private  

### 4 Test  
- A timed version of a Collection (e.g. ‚Äú15-minute Biology Quiz‚Äù)  

### 5 Submission  
- A user‚Äôs attempt at a Collection or Test  
- Records which choices were selected, timestamp, and score  
- Supports multiple submissions per Collection for practice
